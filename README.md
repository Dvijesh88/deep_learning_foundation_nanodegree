# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Program

This repository contains all my projects from the [Deep learning nanodegree foundation program by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

## Table of content
   - __Project 1__ (`project_1`): How to build a neural net from scratch using only numpy as a dependency to predict bike sharing rides
   - __Project 2__ (`project_2`): How to build a convolutional neural network able to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
   - __Miniflow__ (`miniflow`): A mini clone of basic tensorflow operations using only numpy as a dependency (other dependecy such as sklearn are used to manipulate the data but not to create the neural net)
   - __Intro to tensorflow__ (`intro-to-tensorflow`): Ipython notebook showing basic tensorflow operations 
   - __Sentiment analysis__ (`sentiment_network`): Will try to classify a section of human generated text as positive or negative
   - __Tensorflow benchmark__ (`tensorflow_benchmark.ipynb`): Used to measure tensorflow rapidity (The results from the notebook come from a computer with an Intel core i7 7700k/32gb RAM/GTX 1070)
