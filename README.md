# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Program

This repository contains all my projects from the [Deep learning nanodegree foundation program by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

## Table of content
   - __Project 1__ (`project_1`): How to build a neural net from scratch using only numpy as a dependency to predict bike sharing rides
   - __Project 2__ (`project_2`): How to build a convolutional neural network able to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
   - __Project 3__ (`project_3`): How to generate tv scripts using RNN. The dataset to train the network will be the one from the Simpsons tv show
   - __Project 4__ (`project_4`): How to train seq2seq models to translate English sentences to French 
   - __Miniflow__ (`miniflow`): A mini clone of basic tensorflow operations using only numpy as a dependency (other dependecy such as sklearn are used to manipulate the data but not to create the neural net)
   - __Intro to tensorflow__ (`intro-to-tensorflow`): Ipython notebook showing basic tensorflow operations 
   - __Sentiment analysis__ (`sentiment_network`/`sentiment_network_rnn`): Will try to classify a section of human generated text as positive or negative (the second project uses RNN)
   - __Neural nets weight initialization__(`weight-initialization`): Shows how the weight initialization can affect the training of a model and how important it is to initialize the weights properly.
   - __Tensorflow benchmark__ (`tensorflow_benchmark.ipynb`): Used to measure tensorflow rapidity (The results from the notebook come from a computer with an Intel core i7 7700k/32gb RAM/GTX 1070)
